# Giftlax
The simple site that effortlessly tracks all your special occasions, gift ideas, and expenses. It's a CRUD app built on React, Next.js, and Pocketbase.

**Disclaimer:** Giftlax is a personal project I built to learn cool technologies like React, how to work with databases, and how to deploy full-stack projects. However, please keep in mind that Giftlax is more of an experiment than a fully polished product, so there might be bugs, vulnerabilities, or limitations that could affect its performance or compromise user data (but your Google account is safe).

**For more:** If you're curious and want to dig deeper into the project, you can check out the blog post at https://probablyalexzhu.github.io/.
