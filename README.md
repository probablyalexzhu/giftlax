# [Giftlax](https://giftlax.vercel.app/)

Effortlessly track all your special occasions, gift ideas, and expenses. It's a CRUD app with authentication, built on React, Next.js 13, and Pocketbase, deployed on Vercel and Fly.io.

> **Warning**
> Giftlax is a personal project I built to learn cool technologies like React, how to work with databases, and how to deploy full-stack projects. However, please keep in mind that Giftlax is more of an experiment than a fully polished product, so there might be bugs, vulnerabilities, or limitations that could affect its performance or compromise user data (but your Google account is safe).

## Tech Stack

- React
- Chakra UI
- Next.js
- Auth.js
